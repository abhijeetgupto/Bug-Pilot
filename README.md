Bug Pilot

The goal of this work is to identify weak spots in API keys for existing web-based infrastructure.The potential security risks associated with these keys, however, are often overlooked or ignored. Our goal is to create a system that can identify and warn users of vulnerable API keys, such as those that have been leaked or shared without permission. This project will examine code projects for API vulnerabilities using regex patterns and efficient searching algorithms. Our project's goal is to strengthen the safety of all web-based infrastructure by offering a reliable method of discovering API key vulnerabilities.

As of now it can detect any leaks related to these keys:

        google_api
        google_captcha
        google_oauth
        amazon_aws_access_key_id
        amazon_mws_auth_toke
        amazon_aws_url
        facebook_access_token
        authorization_basic
        authorization_bearer
        authorization_api
        mailgun_api_key
        twilio_api_key
        twilio_account_sid
        twilio_app_sid
        paypal_braintree_access_token
        square_oauth_secret
        square_access_token
        stripe_standard_api
        stripe_restricted_api
        github_access_token
        rsa_private_key
        ssh_dsa_private_key
        ssh_dc_private_key
        pgp_private_block
        json_web_token

You can check for vulnerabilitie either by directly uploading the zip file of your project, or by providing the github repo link or by giving the link of a live website.
